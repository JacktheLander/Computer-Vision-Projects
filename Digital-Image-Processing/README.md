# Digital Image Processing

In Digital Signal Processing by Professor Wood I learned to perform frequency analyses and design 2D filters in MATLAB

My final project uses low level vision methods to segment the eyes from the 92x112 grayscale images in the [AT&T Database of Faces](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kasikrit/att-database-of-faces). The final pipeline can be found in /Eye-Detection/FinalPipeline, and you can read my paper [here](https://jacklanders.site/Publications/Eye%20Segmentation%20with%20Low-Level%20Vision%20Methods.pdf)
