Best simplified model saved with accuracy: 54.91% to checkpoint.pth
-
// Added 3rd convolution block, global average pooling, fully connected layers, and a dropout layer
// Improved significantly but was too slow, Batch size = 64 is too large and spotted error in training data
// Training includes images with multiple classes - this is harmful to training, should include only one class/image or multi-label classification
