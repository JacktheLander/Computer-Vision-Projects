# Computer Vision Projects
This is a repository of Python projects I made to further my understanding of computer vision and image processing, a technology that I am especially passionate about

# YOLO
These projects use Ultralytics YOLO for object detection

# PyTorch
I trained my models for identifying surgical tools using the dataset found here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dilavado/labeled-surgical-tools/data

# OpenCV
These projects are from online courses found here: https://www.computervision.zone/course-list/
